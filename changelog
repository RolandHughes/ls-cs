LsCs (0.3.1) stagle; urgency=low
	* dropped support for Ubuntu 18.04 it may still work but you need newer versions of CMake and a few other things.
	* removed webkit
	* removed qdeclarative
	* removed system strings that said CopperSpice
	* added Liberation Sans font
	* removed mingw support
	* local build now deploys cmake files along with lscs.conf
	* removed RPATH ${origin}hacking CopperSpice relied upon. Secured environments will not allow you to do that.
	* cleaned up the install directory tree.
	* lscs.conf is now found where it should be and most legacy bugs that still exists in Qt today of not respecting paths is fixed. Cannot fix Libraries conf issue because Gnu LibTool does not work as advertised. It is supposed to have a compile option that will let it use itself to open all dependencies down the tree, but the official developer mailing list can't figure out how to make that work. Documentation for the project is really poor.
LsCs (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low
	* Fixed QTBUG-12055 where QTextStream disconnect was queued across threads.
LsCs (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low
	* Deeper branding changes.
	* Created LsCs-library.conf for library paths so now we have proper SONAME linking
	* Fixed architectural flaw with plugin loading.
	* Purged really nasty use of RPATH which isn't allowed in secure Linux
	versions.
	* Added lscs.conf to share directory so app developers can "just use it"
	* Fixed architectural flaw where .conf file had to be resource compiled
	into program. This mean it could never be compiled into tools. Added
	AA_UseSystemConf to work around this design flaw.
	* Converted tools so they can run from anywhere.
	* Eliminated tilde expansion code duplication.
	* Added simple-text-editor example
LsCs (0.1.0) unstable; urgency=low
	* Initial branding change.
	* Added astyle file to help enforce coding style change.
	* Added check for root in build script.
	* Added console example and script to build examples.
	* pkgconfig relocation.
	* Standardized Ubuntu 20.04 as primary development platform.
