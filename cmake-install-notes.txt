cmake-install-notes.txt

These notes are for Linux. If you want to do Windows configuration see

windows-configuration-notes.txt

If you happen to be running a Ubuntu version directly supported by
Kitware, you can visit

            apt.kitware.com

and pull down kitware-archive.sh then run it to configure your
repositories to use their repos. After that you can

sudo snap install --classic cmake

or use Synaptic package manager. You cannot use apt-get install because
the kitware repos only have a snap.

If you do not care about being able to do a clean uninstall later, the
easiest way is to visit

https://cmake.org/download/

download the version you wish then copy it to /usr/local/src
cd /usr/local

/usr/local$ sudo ./src/cmake-4.2.1-linux-x86_64.sh

Do you accept the license? [yn]: 
y
By default the CMake will be installed in:
  "/usr/local/cmake-4.2.1-linux-x86_64"
Do you want to include the subdirectory cmake-4.2.1-linux-x86_64?
Saying no will install in: "/usr/local" [Yn]: 
n

Most important that you say no to the subdirectory unless you want
to do a lot more work adding this to your PATH. By default on Ubuntu
/usr/local directories are added to PATH, but not /usr/local/src.

echo $PATH
/home/developer/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin

No matter which way you install, you should probably reboot to ensure the
directory scans happen.
