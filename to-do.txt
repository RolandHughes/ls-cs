* local build needs to deploy cmake files
* example build needs to work with local build libraries
* Replace default fonts with liberation
* Nuke the 3rdparty fonts directory once fonts replaced

* cleaning up the install directory tree
* renaming and relocating Qt header files to avoid collisions
* making SDL3 the primary underlying library. All QPlatform code will be replaced by a new LsPlatform class based exclusively on SDL3.
* UTF-8 for internal character encoding.
* QChar will be replaced by LsChar which will be based on work already done in BasisDoctrina. 
* All flavors of QString will go away and be replaced by work already done in bd_string for BasisDoctrina. 
* Containers will become wrappers for STL templates/classes.
* One by one all low level graphics classes will be replaced by wrappers for SDL3 functionality.
* CUPS 3.x support.

Once we get the last of the Qt/CopperSpice stuff out, a VCPKG build for Windows will be created.

A cross compile will then be created for ArmV8.
