%changelog
* Sunday March 1 2026  Roland Hughes <roland@logikalsolutions.com> - 0.3.1
- dropped support for Ubuntu 18.04 it may still work but you need newer versions of CMake and a few other things.
- removed webkit
- removed qdeclarative
- removed system strings that said CopperSpice
- added Liberation Sans font
- removed mingw support
- local build now deploys cmake files along with lscs.conf
- removed RPATH ${origin}hacking CopperSpice relied upon. Secured environments will not allow you to do that.
- cleaned up the install directory tree.
- lscs.conf is now found where it should be and most legacy bugs that still exists in Qt today of not respecting paths is fixed. Cannot fix Libraries conf
