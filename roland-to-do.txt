*) have to diff the annex files against their lscs_ counterparts. Copperspice broke them out as individual libraries.

*) have to grep for CS_ that is not LSCS_  and Cs_ that is not LsCs_ 
   CsCore that is not LsCsCore
   _NAMESPACE
   cs_internal needs to be lscs_internal
   csPrintable  
   Must diff qt_windows.h against lscs_windows.h 
   diff kernel/csmeta* csobject* csregister* against kernel lscs*
   CS_DOXYPRESS
   CsPointer
   


why does my global.cmake have qglobal_debug.h and lscs_windows.h when theirs only has qt_windows.h 

qglobal.h needs a much closer look.

*) replace QT_NO_DEBUG with LSCS_NO_DEBUG

Must diff cs_ annex directories against lscs_ annex directories.

Will probably have C++20 stuff to revert

Did I leave in the XP stuff?

grep -rl --exclude-dir=.git 'search_term' . | xargs sed -i 's/search_term/replace_term/g'


C++ has had a regular expression library since C++11 so why have one in Basis Doctrina?
